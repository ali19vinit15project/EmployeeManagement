I would like to do this using Spring Data REST. 
My approach was to include a MultipartFile in the DataFile entity and mark it @Transient and @RestResource(exported = false)
 so it is not in any representation of the entity but can be uploaded. 
 When uploaded an AbstractRepositoryEventListener overrides onBeforeCreate and uploads the file during this step

 Using EventListeners
If all you want to do is intercept the CRUD operations backing the exposed resources you can implement a AbstractRepositoryEventListener. 
It allows you to synchronously intercept the actions the Spring Data REST controllers impose on the entities. 
Use cases to be mentioned here can be additional validation, logging, filtering etc.
